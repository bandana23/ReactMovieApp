This is a react application for movie application.
I am using the movie api(https://api.themoviedb.org/3) to get the movie result.
In this React Website we can see a list of movies and  a search bar to search movie from the list.

In this application I can select favorites movies and display on the favorites page.
Home Page: 

It displays list of movies fetching data from apis and in the movie list I can set movie as favorite if its favorite the heart sign is red else its white.

Favorite Page: It displays list of favorite movies.
